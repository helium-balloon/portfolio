            What does it mean to redesign a website? I undertook this question
            by exploring the workflow of redesigning a website through
            brainstorming, sketching, wireframing, and coding a final design. I
            focused on redesigning a website to prioritize the user’s needs,
            improve accessibility, and enhance the aesthetics of the site.

      <div id="research">
        <p>
          I chose to redesign a local dentistry website linked
          <a href="https://goodteeth.com/">here</a> it's an important tool for
          users to access health care and resources. Having an easy to use,
          accessible interface is vital for websites pertaining to medicine.
        </p>
        <p>
          I broke down my research into UX design principles and accessibility
          to target specific parts of the current design that could be improved
          for a better user experience, although many of the considerations I
          found overlap between the two ideas.

          <h3>UX Design Principles</h3>
          <p>
            Using three principles of UX design, efficiency, learnability, and
            memorability, I analyzed the website.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h4>Efficiency</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The eye is drawn to the picture of the model in the middle of
                the page rather than the text and important information on the
                site
              </li>
              <li>
                The text is very small and the information does not take up the
                whole page; even the headlines are difficult to read which makes
                it hard to know what to look at
              </li>
              <li>
                The page isn’t responsive to a smaller device, making it more
                difficult to move quickly to do a task
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Learnability</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Users have to go to multiple pages to get to certain pages which
                can be frustrating and difficult to learn
              </li>
              <li>
                The page isn’t responsive to smaller devices which makes it
                harder to use and learn how to navigate
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Memorability</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                There is a big block of text, making it difficult to pull away
                key points
              </li>
              <li>
                The navigation bar is straightforward, but users may have
                trouble remembering how to navigate to certain pages which take
                multiple clicks to get there
              </li>
              <li>
                Visuals of website is outdated, which could discourage users
                from using the site
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Accessibility</h3>
          <p>
            I used WebAIM to learn about the accessibility of this site. I
            found:
          </p>
          <img
            src="../assets/webaim.png"
            alt="Results from WebAIM on dentist original website"
          />
          <ul>
            <li>
              18 contrast errors where there was not enough contrast between a
              light background color and white text. The white on a very light
              blue background can be hard to read
            </li>
            <li>
              Only 1 feature, meaning this page was not split up into HTML
              element sections such as header, main, and footer
            </li>
            <li>
              5 errors due to missing alternative text for images. Missing
              alternative text for images stops those who depend on this feature
              to use the page
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          Using the information gathered from WebAIM and assessing the design
          aspects of the page, I next crafted lo fi wireframes to improve
          usability.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          I created low-fidelity wireframes: one for desktop, one for tablet,
          and one for mobile. The most notable changes I made were creating
          views for desktop, tablet, and mobile, and ensuring that the content
          took up the full width of the page which allowed me to increase text
          size, increase image size, and spread out information for a cleaner
          feel for the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are my wireframes for tablet (left), desktop (middle), and
          mobile (right):
        </p>
        <img src="../assets/wireframes.png" alt="Wireframes" />
        <p>
          After creating low-fidelity wireframes, I put together a style guide
          for the website redesign. I knew that I wanted to give the website a
          similar feel to the original site. To do this, I took into account the
          logo colors and website colors while also making new choises for font,
          icons, and some other colors.
        </p>
        <img
          src="../assets/style-guide-dentist.png"
          alt="Style Guide for Redesigned Dentistry Website"
        />
        <ul>
          <li>
            I used the green and dark blue from the logo as part of my color
            palette along with white, a light shade of blue and a medium shade
            of blue.
          </li>
          <li>
            I chose Lato and Gothic A1 for their simplicity and readability.
          </li>
          <li>
            I used Font Awesome for my icon library, which allowed me to find
            icons that fit the function of each of the buttons in this website.
          </li>
          <li>
            Initially, I had chosen a lighter blue for the main blue color of
            this redesign, but through testing with WebAIM, I learned that there
            was not enough contrast, so I changed the style guide to reflect a
            deeper shade of blue that allows for better contrast when white text
            is on it.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>
        I used my lo fi wireframes and research about accessibility and design
        to put together final hi fi wireframes. Then, I used these wireframes to
        code the website using HTML and CSS which you can find
        <a
          href="https://helium-balloon.github.io/dentistry-responsive-redesign/"
          >here</a
        >. This website is a culmination of the important choices I made
        throughout the process ensuring that users can get to information easily
        and all users on a variety of devices are able to access the information
        easily.

      <h2>Learnings</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Throughout this process, I learned the full workflow of creating a
          redesign for a website, from brainstorming to a final front-end
          product. This process taught me the importance of and skills for
          designing with a user in mind, applying design principles, and coding
          a responsive site.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this site in particular because it relates to healthcare, having a
          clear website that works on a variety of devices is extremely
          important to reach as many people as possible. By incorporating
          features such as contrasting colors, HTML5 semantic elements, and
          descriptive alt tags for images, my redesign aims to enhance user
          experience and ensure that the site is accessible to a diverse
          audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          The skills acquired during this project are vital going forward to
          allow me to confidently approach any future project and have a
          comprehensive understanding of how the elements of the design process
          help to produce effective outcomes.
