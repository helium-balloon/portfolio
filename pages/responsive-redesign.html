            What does it mean to redesign a website? I undertook this question
            by exploring the workflow of redesigning a website through
            brainstorming, sketching, wireframing, and coding a final design. I
            focused on redesigning a website to prioritize the user’s needs,
            improve accessibility, and enhance the aesthetics of the site.

            <p>
              I chose to redesign a local dentistry website linked
              <a href="https://goodteeth.com/">here</a> it's an important tool
              for users to access health care and resources. Having an easy to
              use, accessible interface is vital for websites pertaining to
              medicine.
            </p>
            <p>
              I broke down my research into UX design principles and
              accessibility to target specific parts of the current design that
              could be improved for a better user experience, although many of
              the considerations I found overlap between the two ideas.

          <h3>UX Design Principles</h3>
          <p>
            Using three principles of UX design, efficiency, learnability, and
            memorability, I analyzed the website.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h4>Efficiency</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The eye is drawn to the picture of the model in the middle of
                the page rather than the text and important information on the
                site
              </li>
              <li>
                The text is very small and the information does not take up the
                whole page; even the headlines are difficult to read which makes
                it hard to know what to look at
              </li>
              <li>
                The page isn’t responsive to a smaller device, making it more
                difficult to move quickly to do a task
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Learnability</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Users have to go to multiple pages to get to certain pages which
                can be frustrating and difficult to learn
              </li>
              <li>
                The page isn’t responsive to smaller devices which makes it
                harder to use and learn how to navigate
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Memorability</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                There is a big block of text, making it difficult to pull away
                key points
              </li>
              <li>
                The navigation bar is straightforward, but users may have
                trouble remembering how to navigate to certain pages which take
                multiple clicks to get there
              </li>
              <li>
                Visuals of website is outdated, which could discourage users
                from using the site
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Accessibility</h3>
          <p>
            I used WebAIM to learn about the accessibility of this site. I
            found:
          </p>
          <div class="half-text-img">
            <div class="middle">
              <img
                class="re-img"
                src="../assets/webaim.png"
                alt="Results from WebAIM on dentist original website"
              />
            </div>
            <div class="webaim-bullets">
              <ul id="remove-margin">
                <li>
                  18 contrast errors where there was not enough contrast between
                  a light background color and white text. The white on a very
                  light blue background can be hard to read
                </li>
                <li>
                  Only 1 feature, meaning this page was not split up into HTML
                  element sections such as header, main, and footer
                </li>
                <li>
                  5 errors due to missing alternative text for images. Missing
                  alternative text for images stops those who depend on this
                  feature to use the page
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            Using the information gathered from WebAIM and assessing the design
            aspects of the page, I next crafted lo fi wireframes to improve
            usability.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          I created low-fidelity wireframes: one for desktop, one for tablet,
          and one for mobile. The most notable changes I made were creating
          views for desktop, tablet, and mobile, and ensuring that the content
          took up the full width of the page which allowed me to increase text
          size, increase image size, and spread out information for a cleaner
          feel for the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are my wireframes for tablet (left), desktop (middle), and
          mobile (right):
        </p>
        <img class="re-img" src="../assets/wireframes.png" alt="Wireframes" />
        <p>
          After creating low-fidelity wireframes, I put together a style guide
          for the website redesign. I knew that I wanted to give the website a
          similar feel to the original site. To do this, I took into account the
          logo colors and website colors while also making new choises for font,
          icons, and some other colors.
        </p>
        <div class="half-text-img">
          <div class="middle">
            <img
              class="re-img2"
              src="../assets/style-guide-dentist.png"
              alt="Style Guide for Redesigned Dentistry Website"
            />
          </div>
          <div class="webaim-bullets">
            <ul>
              <li>
                I used the green and dark blue from the logo as part of my color
                palette along with white, a light shade of blue and a medium
                shade of blue.
              </li>
              <li>
                I chose Lato and Gothic A1 for their simplicity and readability.
              </li>
              <li>
                I used Font Awesome for my icon library, which allowed me to
                find icons that fit the function of each of the buttons in this
                website.
              </li>
              <li>
                Initially, I had chosen a lighter blue for the main blue color
                of this redesign, but through testing with WebAIM, I learned
                that there was not enough contrast, so I changed the style guide
                to reflect a deeper shade of blue that allows for better
                contrast when white text is on it.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p id="text-left-margin">
            I used my lo fi wireframes and research about accessibility and
            design to put together final hi fi wireframes. Then, I used these
            wireframes to code the website using HTML and CSS which you can find
            <a
              href="https://helium-balloon.github.io/dentistry-responsive-redesign/"
              ><b>here</b></a
            >. This website is a culmination of the important choices I made
            throughout the process ensuring that users can get to information
            easily and all users on a variety of devices are able to access the
            information easily.

      <h2>Learnings</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Throughout this process, I learned the full workflow of creating a
          redesign for a website, from brainstorming to a final front-end
          product. This process taught me the importance of and skills for
          designing with a user in mind, applying design principles, and coding
          a responsive site.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this site in particular because it relates to healthcare, having a
          clear website that works on a variety of devices is extremely
          important to reach as many people as possible. By incorporating
          features such as contrasting colors, HTML5 semantic elements, and
          descriptive alt tags for images, my redesign aims to enhance user
          experience and ensure that the site is accessible to a diverse
          audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          The skills acquired during this project are vital going forward to
          allow me to confidently approach any future project and have a
          comprehensive understanding of how the elements of the design process
          help to produce effective outcomes.
