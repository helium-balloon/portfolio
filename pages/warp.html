          <p>
            For this project, my team and I worked with Warp to design a home
            page based on their project brief. This was an amazing opportunity
            to learn about designing with a team and complete the iterative
            design process (sketches, low fidelity wireframe, and high fidelity
            prototypes). We also received feedback on our wireframe from both
            students in our class, a Senior Product Designer at Warp, and a
            Design Executive at Google Ventures in order to improve our design.

      <h2>About the Product</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.warp.dev/">Warp</a> is a customizable terminal with
        collaborative tools and AI integration. Warp does not have a centralized
        home page for users to view information about their files, team, usage,
        account and learn more about Warp. Currently, a lot of this information
        is in the settings page, which makes it difficult to find. The home page
        that we designed will serve as an aggregator that ultimately allows for
        increased discovery and usage of Warp’s features.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <h4>Research and Sketching</h4>
      <div id="sketches">
        <div id="sketch-writing">
          <p>
            To begin this project, we first delved into understanding the
            project brief, exploring prior work, and researching Warp to
            understand the product. We then each created at least 8 sketches to
            explore different layouts for the screen and modules (components on
            the screen) as well as layouts for different user states (new user
            versus active user).

            Our main goal with the home page was to create a user-friendly,
            glanceable interface that allows users to understand their current
            state and easily access their content. We achieved this by:
          </p>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Merging the current drive on Warp into our new home pages to improve
            intuitive usability and reduce time spent searching for desired
            content.
          </li>
          <li>
            Centralizing metrics, live sessions, activity, and Warp content on a
            left hand sidebar and aimed for visual appeal by using profile icons
            for team members, filled bars for metrics, and link icons to
            indicate that clicking on the Warp resources would redirect users.
          </li>
          <li>
            Seamlessly switching between personal and team views with the toggle
            to organize content while still keeping team information accessible
          </li>
          <li>
            Catering to both new users (requiring more instructional guidance)
            and active users (with their current content readily accessible).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Ultimately, our design aligns with the priorities outlined in our
          project brief and enhances the discovery of Warp’s features by moving
          key functionalities from the settings page to the home page.

        <h4>Feedback on Wireframes</h4>
        <p>
          I filmed a five minute presentation of our wireframe using Loom to
          share with peers and our contact at Warp to gain feedback.

            <ul>
              <li>
                It is unclear how to get from the current view to the terminal
                and how to get from the terminal to this view.
              </li>
              <li>
                You should ensure that the order of modules on the left
                navigation bar is based on what is most important to the user.
              </li>
              <li>
                People may want to have more control over how they see the items
                in their drive. For instance, you could have an option to toggle
                between list and gallery mode, filters and sorting.
              </li>

        <h4>Second Iteration Wireframes</h4>
        <p>
          These are our second iteration lo-fi wireframes, which were revised
          based on the feedback that we recieved:
        </p>

          />
        </div>
        <p>
          We incorporated most of the feedback in our second iteration. This
          includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Removing the metrics from the left sidebar since metrics was last on
            our priorities list, and it did not feel necessary for users to
            constantly see this information (better in the account page).
          </li>
          <li>
            Adding basic drive features we missed: trash, search bar, sorting,
            filters, modes for viewing (list and grid)
          </li>
          <li>
            Changing toggle (navigating between “Personal” and “Team”) to a
            drop-down so users can be on multiple teams.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using the same top bar as the Warp app, but adding a new tab for the
            home page, to easily navigate between the home page and terminal.

          Our project focuses on depicting the design of the home page based on
          the user state and the various actions that they can take. Here is an
          active user navigating through their personal home page to one of
          their team drives:
        </p>
        <video loop autoplay muted>
          <source src="../assets/warp/highfi.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
          Your browser does not support the video tag.

        <img class="highfiImg" src="../assets/warp/highfi-admin.png" />
        <p>
          Throughout this process, we emphasized meeting the user's need of
          being able to access all information in a central and easy to use
          location as well as creating an experience that is applicable to all
          users on the platform. We emphasized key design principles in our
          final prototype to fulfill to do this by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Ensuring that our design aligns with the mental model users
            currently have of a homepage by making all information accessible
            from the page, making it the central location.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using scan patterns to create a layout that is efficient for users
            through the F scan pattern.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using hierarchical design to create a easy to understand layout.

        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="final-feedback">

          <p>
            Through this project, I learned a lot about designing as a team and
            interacting with real clients in order to achieve a design goal. One
            of the key challenges we faced was translating Warp's vision into
            tangible designs. This required not only creative problem-solving
            but also a deep understanding of design principles and user
            experience considerations. We took their feedback and continuously
            iterated on our designs, constantly striving to align with their
            expectations while also incorporating our own expertise and
            insights. I'm so grateful for this experience to strength my design
            and communication skills, and I'm ready to utilize these skills
            moving forward.

        As a member of this team, I had a role in each step of the process, from
        <b>sketching</b>, to <b>making design decisions</b>, to
        <b>filming a presentation</b>
        of our design. I created 10 sketches (pictured above) in the first part
        of this project. In addition, I planned meetings with our group where we
        discussed in depth and worked together to create a Figma together
        bringing together all of our designs. After we finalized our first
        iteration of wireframes, I prepared for and filmed a 5 min Loom video
        which we sent to the Product Designer at Warp to receive feedback. I
        also worked with my team to update our first iteration to second
        iteration, created the style guide, and co-wrote the hand-in case study.
