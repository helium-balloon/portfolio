            The aim of this project is to facilitate CS0320 collaboration hours.
            At present, collab hours are a little bit hectic, with the TAs
            trying to call out names to pair students from their google forms,
            while also trying to help students with escalated issues. This
            project can ease this experience for students and TAs, and make
            collab hours more productive. There is also large variety in how
            collab hours are run and the partnering process, so this project can
            also standardize collab section.

      <h2>What are Collab Hours?</h2>
      <div class="half-text-img">
        <div>
          <p>
            CS0320 is the software engineering course at Brown University. This
            course doesn't have one-on-one debugging hours with TAs as other
            courses do; rather, there are structured, TA-mentored collab
            sections where students get debugging helpâ€”both from the TA and from
            peers. Other courses have long queues to be able to meet with a TA
            one-on-one, but through this system students can get help right
            away. The current system is run by TAs without a program to aid the
            organization of the hours. Below are some key definitions for this
            project:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Help Requester</b> - a student attending hours to obtain help
              on a question or bug
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Debugging Partner</b> - a student providing help to students
              attending hours
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Instructor</b> - a TA (Teaching Assistant) or course professor
              who facilitates hours
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="middle">

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <div id="research">
        <p>
          We started by conducting user interviews with the current course
          instructor, TAs for the class, and students, as these would be the
          users of our program. These interviews helped us to understand what
          features would be most beneficial to develop as well as some stretch
          goals that could be implemented later.
        </p>
        <p>
          Completing user research interviews were incredibly useful to help our
          team understand the priorities for the stakeholders involved in this
          situation. We used this information gathered from user interviews to
          create our project plan detailing our project specifications, scope,
          and timeline. Over the course of 4 weeks, we planned to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Develop <b>concurrent algorithm</b> that matches debugging partners
            automatically
          </li>
          <li>
            Create <b>easy to use interfaces</b> for instructors, help
            requesters, and debugging partners
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Instructors:</b> Dashboard to view all debugging partners and
              all help requesters as they enter the queues, as well as all
              current pairs, to monitor the students that are getting help
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Help Requesters:</b> Dashboard where user can end their
              debugging session once their debugging partner has finished
              helping, so debugging partner is reassigned to other students
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Debugging Partners:</b> Dashboard with easy access to the name
              of my help requester, the debugging recipe, and a way to escalate
              a bug to a teaching assistant
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            <b>Download records</b> of all debugging partners to keep track of
            attendance
          </li>
          <li>Flag absent debugging partners</li>
          <li>
            <b>Implement timer</b> to let students know how long they are paired
            so after 15 minutes, the pair can be escalated to the TA level
          </li>
          <li>
            Notify TA when debugging partner needs to escalate a bug for
            additional help
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>
        We designed an initial UI sketch of our front-end interface to visualize
        how the system flow would work from start to finish as a debugger and a
        help requester.

        Then, over the course of 4 weeks, we broke up the steps and developed
        our application! I focused on both backend and frontend development in
        this project.

        <li><b>Dashboards</b> - Instructor, help requester, debug partner</li>

      <h2>Learnings</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Throughout this process, I learned more about working well with a
          team, through effective communication and asking for help from my
          teammates. In addition, I got a lot more comfortable working with
          React and working with a large body of code. I can now apply these
          skills to new projects in the future.

      <div>
        <p>
          In this project, I acted as a designer and full stack developer. At
          the beginning of the project, I worked with my teammates to ideate and
          design our project specifications. In our project plan, I laid out the
          organization of our program by breaking down our goals into the
          model-view-controller software pattern and describing what each module
          will do and what data it will need access to. During the development
          phase, I worked on the backend to create the feature that downloads
          attendance and debugging form information. On the frontend, I
          interacted with our backend using API calls to integrate the front end
          and back end.
